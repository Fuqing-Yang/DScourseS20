\section{Introduction}
I am second-year Ph.D. Student in Economics, and the reason I take this class is because I want to get familiar with data science in order to complete own research study in the future.\\
There are two goals for this class.First, I want to get familiar with more software in order to deal with data efficiently. Secondly, I need to learn more about data collection, and reinforcing programming skill.
Currently, I have an idea about the sharing economics of bike. My research topic is how the bike sharing system effects taxi market. In this case, it involves  massive datasets. I think this course will help me to deal with those datasets.\\
For now, I don't have a specific plan about after graduation, and my main goal is keep studying in order to finish my Ph.D. program.
